            My name is Cooper Brown. I am a student at Drake University, double majoring in computer science and
            artificial intelligence. I have three years of experience using python with additional experience in Flask,
            Tkinter, Torch, and SciKit-Learn. I also have two years of experience using Kotlin and Java to develop both
            desktop and mobile applications. I also
